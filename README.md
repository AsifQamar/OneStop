OneStop is a smart ride-hailing aggregator that finds you the fastest and cheapest cab from services like Uber, Ola, and more‚Äîall in one clean, simple interface. Our mission is to save you time, money, and the frustration of app-juggling.

## The Problem 

Ever found yourself in a hurry, frantically switching between Uber, Ola, and other cab apps just to find a single ride? You check one app, it shows "No cabs available," so you switch to another, compare prices, and waste precious minutes. This process is inefficient, frustrating, and anything but smart.

---

## Our Solution 

OneStop cuts through the noise. Our platform connects to multiple ride-hailing services in the background and presents you with a **single, consolidated list** of all available options. With this, you can instantly see:

-   Which services are **actually available** for your route.
-   Which cab will **reach you the fastest**.
-   A clear **price comparison** to choose the best value.

No more guesswork, no more wasted time. Just the best ride, right away.
